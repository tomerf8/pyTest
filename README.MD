* Notes
1. At some point, Linkedin started to block requests, 
so I wasn't able to complete 100% parse process ('currenct positions')

2. This is a dirty hack solution.
It will be much prettier when using web framework such Django, with DB classed repositories, nice API etc.

3. Main parse function is `parse_page`

* Sample API
1. `/profile/<url>` : fetch linkedin profile
2. `/users` : list saved users
3. `/users/<username>` : query username
4. `/skills` : get top skills



* Requirements
1. see `requirements.txt`
